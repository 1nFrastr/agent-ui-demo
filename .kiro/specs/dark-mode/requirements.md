# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a complete dark mode implementation to the Agent UI application. The app already has dark mode CSS variables defined in Tailwind configuration, but lacks the functionality to toggle between light and dark modes. This feature will provide users with the ability to switch between light and dark themes, with their preference persisted across sessions and automatically applied based on system preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Theme Toggle Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark modes using a visible UI control, so that I can choose the theme that's most comfortable for my eyes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark modes
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate CSS class to the root HTML element
3. WHEN the user is on any page or view THEN the system SHALL display the theme toggle button in a consistent, accessible location
4. WHEN the theme toggle button is rendered THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate icon indicating the current theme state (sun for light mode, moon for dark mode)

### Requirement 2: Theme Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered across browser sessions, so that I don't have to re-select my preferred theme every time I visit the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a theme THEN the system SHALL store the preference in browser localStorage
2. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL retrieve and apply the stored theme preference
3. WHEN no stored preference exists THEN the system SHALL use the system preference as the default
4. WHEN the stored theme preference is retrieved THEN the system SHALL apply it before the initial render to prevent theme flashing

### Requirement 3: System Preference Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically use my operating system's theme preference on first visit, so that the app matches my system settings without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the app for the first time THEN the system SHALL detect the OS theme preference using the prefers-color-scheme media query
2. WHEN the OS theme preference is dark THEN the system SHALL apply dark mode by default
3. WHEN the OS theme preference is light THEN the system SHALL apply light mode by default
4. WHEN the user manually changes the theme THEN the system SHALL override the OS preference with the user's explicit choice

### Requirement 4: Theme Context and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme management system, so that any component in the app can access and modify the current theme state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme provider is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a React context for theme state
2. WHEN any component needs theme information THEN the system SHALL provide access via a custom hook
3. WHEN the theme state changes THEN the system SHALL notify all subscribed components
4. WHEN the theme provider mounts THEN the system SHALL initialize the theme based on stored preference or system default
